# weather_board_hw6

This weeks assignment we were asked to create a weather dashboard that displays a five day forecast for whatever city the user types in. The web application displays temperature, humidity levels, and wind speeds. Every city the user inputs will be saved into local storage and displayed on the screen and can be clicked on to view that information again.
